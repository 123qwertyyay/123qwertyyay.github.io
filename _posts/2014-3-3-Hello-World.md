I am currently (summers'2021) doing a research internship under <a href="https://clancygroup.wse.jhu.edu/">Prof. Paulette Clancy</a> at Johns Hopkins University, United states. This website is meant to keep a track of the same.

## Week 1 : What is molecular finger printing?
Molecular fingerprints are a way of encoding the structure of a molecule. There can be many ways of doing so and that gave motivation to build SEING.
### SEING
<a href="https://seing.readthedocs.io"> SEING</a> is a C/C++ package for fingerprint calculations suitable for machine learning studies of molecular systems. SEING was developed in <a href="http://clancygroup.cbe.cornell.edu/" >the Clancy Group</a> at Cornell University.

During my first week, I learnt about molecular fingerprinting and read <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/me/c8me00003d#!divAbstract">the research paper</a> on SEING.

### Python wrapping
Since the package was build in C/C++, my main task would involve building a python wrapper for it. I reasearched about it found out there are various methods to build a wrapper (something we will decide very soon).
